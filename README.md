# Predicting the Likelihood of a Heart Attack
This research was conducted in groups using data mining techniques to classify and identify symptoms that cause heart attacks. The decision tree algorithm is used because it is a data mining technique that can classify by manipulating variables in a dataset. This variable is classified according to its characteristics. The decision tree algorithm is broken down into smaller subsets, which gradually develop the decision tree. The properties of the classified data are clearly captured in both the structure and decision tree rules, which allow the Anaconda software to use the Python programming language to predict heart attack symptoms during the testing phase. Building a classification model using machine learning improves decision-making accuracy because it can be tested on larger data sets than traditional methods. Models with good accuracy and performance simplify and speed up the process of identifying human heart disease.
